/// - `GlobalWidgetsLocalizations` reports `isSupported == false` for `bo` —
///   handled by falling back whenever `isSupported` is false.
/// - `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` reports `isSupported == true` for `bo`
///   (it's in Flutter's supported-language list) but its `load()` builds
///   `DateFormat` instances internally, and Dart's `intl` package has no
///   locale data for `bo` at all — `DateFormat.y('bo')` throws
///   `ArgumentError: Invalid locale "bo"`, uncaught. Handled by wrapping
///   `load()` in try/catch, not just trusting `isSupported`.
/// Net effect: picking an unsupported/broken locale keeps our own
/// `AppLocalizations` (app UI strings) on that locale, while framework
/// widgets (date pickers, default dialog buttons, etc.) silently fall back
/// to English instead of crashing the whole app.
///
/// Deliberately NOT an `async` method: `flutter_localizations`' delegates
/// return a `SynchronousFuture` and — critically — the observed `bo` crash
/// is a plain synchronous throw during `load()`, not an async error. An
/// `async`/`await` wrapper here would still catch that, but it also forces
/// this Future to resolve on a later microtask even when the primary
/// resolves synchronously, which breaks `Localizations`' synchronous
/// fast-path (`_LocalizationsState.load`'s `if (typeToResources != null)`
/// check) for every locale, not just `bo`. That fast-path is what makes a
/// locale change take effect in the same frame instead of one frame late —
/// worth preserving. A plain (non-async) try/catch around the synchronous
/// call catches the same exception without paying that cost. (`.catchError`
/// is avoided too: `SynchronousFuture.catchError` returns a Future that
/// never completes, since a `SynchronousFuture` is documented to never
/// error — silently swallowing a real fallback need.)
